Larvixon is an artificial intelligence to recognize and monitor the movement of larvae from the attached video file. It was based on my earlier algorithm for detecting the movement of Galleria Mellonella larvae. Larvixon is my first project and my first time trying my hand and skills in programming. Larvixon was developed on the UBUNTU 22.04 system making full use of Python as a programming language. I also made an effort to provide a good detection tool. For this purpose I used YOLOv5 - it seemed the best algorithm to use.

Here's how Larvixon searches for larvae in the video footage and how he tracks them. The larvae are placed on a solid background (blue or black) and move inside square Petri dishes. Below I attach two pictures of how the detection and monitoring of Galleria Melonella movement is done.

Larvixon has also been equipped with a GUI (graphical user interface) in the form of a web page so that potential users can easily use the program.
